# Small fixes
TODO @alex: add descriptive message to SDL::loadTexture exceptions, similarly to SDL::loadFont

# Optional features for later
TODO offset background rendering by the height of the highest row that is completely solid in the collision map (consecutive from the bottom, again calculate at makeRoom time)

# Big features
--- Mob rendering
TODO load mobs into rooms
TODO make mobs movable
TODO Mob rendering in room - store the dimensions of the render target in mob definition to enable multiple sizes of mobs
---
TODO add viewport support to the renderer, which will greatly simplify HUD and menus


# Refactoring
TODO switch the specification of mobs, instead of specifying a protocol for mobs as a whole, specify components, and then add/skip them when needed (e.g. moving, attacking, damage-aura, ...)
TODO @bennett move Position including operators to $SDL/Rectangle.hpp and base it on SDL_Point. rename header to something else, reflecting the advanced functionality that we will have there.

# Game object
TODO Save event handler, etc. as fields in game class
TODO extract keyboard shortcut setting etc. into methods called by game class constructor
TODO add method to start the main loop
TODO hold and render currently open room and the player
TODO keep a stack of menus. Iff empty, render current room

# Physics (depends on Game object)
TODO collision detection
TODO gravity
