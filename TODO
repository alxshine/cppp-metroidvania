# Small fixes
TODO @alex: add descriptive message to SDL::loadTexture exceptions, similarly to SDL::loadFont
TODO make animations keep state and work using delta time so they always start from the start - very important for attacks, deaths, etc!
TODO make animations optionally not repeatable (default param) - very important for attacks, deaths, etc!

# Optional features for later
TODO offset background rendering by the height of the highest row that is completely solid in the collision map (consecutive from the bottom, again calculate at makeRoom time)

# Big features
--- Mob rendering
TODO transform mob position when adding to room (in makeRoom) to allow using tile coordinates instead of pixels in room definition
---
TODO add viewport support to the renderer, which will greatly simplify HUD and menus

# Refactoring
TODO switch the specification of mobs, instead of specifying a protocol for mobs as a whole, specify components, and then add/skip them when needed (e.g. moving, attacking, damage-aura, ...)
TODO decide what to do with the flipped y axis - do we want to flip the axis in the game logic and invert when rendering...? either way will be confusing because the rooms are of varying height.

# Game object
TODO Save event handler, etc. as fields in game class
TODO extract keyboard shortcut setting etc. into methods called by game class constructor
TODO add method to start the main loop
TODO hold and render currently open room and the player
TODO keep a stack of menus. Iff empty, render current room

# Physics (depends on Game object)
TODO collision detection
TODO gravity
