# Small fixes
TODO replace OptionalAnimation type with std::optional<std::reference_wrapper<Animation>>?

# Optional features for later
TODO offset background rendering by the height of the highest row that is completely solid in the collision map (consecutive from the bottom, again calculate at makeRoom time)

# Big features
--- Map
TODO track visited rooms in state object by name
TODO load/save visited rooms
TODO display map (show savepoints and doors)
---

--- Inventory
TODO store bitmask or list of item names in Player or Game
TODO allow items that are not doors or savepoints to be picked up in Game::interact()
TODO load/save inventory

TODO create inventory menu that displays the contents of the inventory
---

--- Gating : Requires Inventory
TODO allow restricting rooms until corresponding key is in inventory (unless key number is 0)
TODO in Game::interact(), display "This door is locked." MessageBox if required key for target room is missing

TODO allow rooms to drop items after they were cleared
TODO somewhere in attack/death handling, check whether room was cleared and add onCleared items
TODO somehow set enemies to dead when loading a room that was already cleared -- by checking if an onCleared key is in the inventory??
---

--- Stats
TODO create stats menu that displays stats
---

# Refactoring
TODO switch the specification of mobs, instead of specifying a protocol for mobs as a whole, specify components, and then add/skip them when needed (e.g. moving, attacking, damage-aura, ...)
TODO decide what to do with the flipped y axis - do we want to flip the axis in the game logic and invert when rendering...? either way will be confusing because the rooms are of varying height.
