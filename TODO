TODO @alex: add descriptive message to SDL::loadTexture exceptions, similarly to SDL::loadFont
TODO switch the specification of mobs, instead of specifying a protocol for mobs as a whole, specify components, and then add/skip them when needed (e.g. moving, attacking, damage-aura, ...)
TODO @alex create enum for collision (e.g. no collision = 0, jump through = 1, full collision = 2) and use max over all layers (preprocess once)
TODO offset background rendering by the height of the highest row that is completely solid in the collision map (consecutive from the bottom, again calculate at makeRoom time)
