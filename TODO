# Small fixes
TODO replace OptionalAnimation type with std::optional<std::reference_wrapper<Animation>>?
TODO improve verticall scrolling to use the *top* of the hitbox.

# Optional features for later
TODO offset background rendering by the height of the highest row that is completely solid in the collision map (consecutive from the bottom, again calculate at makeRoom time)

# Big features
--- Inventory
TODO load/save inventory
---

--- Gating : Requires Inventory
TODO somehow set enemies to dead when loading a room that was already cleared -- by checking if an onCleared key is in the inventory??
---

--- Stats
TODO create stats menu that displays stats
---

# Refactoring
TODO switch the specification of mobs, instead of specifying a protocol for mobs as a whole, specify components, and then add/skip them when needed (e.g. moving, attacking, damage-aura, ...)
