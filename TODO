# Small fixes
TODO @alex: add descriptive message to SDL::loadTexture exceptions, similarly to SDL::loadFont
TODO make animations keep state and work using delta time so they always start from the start - very important for attacks, deaths, etc!
TODO make animations optionally not repeatable (default param) - very important for attacks, deaths, etc!

# Optional features for later
TODO offset background rendering by the height of the highest row that is completely solid in the collision map (consecutive from the bottom, again calculate at makeRoom time)

# Big features
--- Mob rendering
TODO transform mob position when adding to room (in makeRoom) to allow using tile coordinates instead of pixels in room definition
---
--- Doors
TODO create door objects and store them in rooms
TODO properly render doors
TODO add interaction method to game::Game and/or game::Room which (takes a player and?) calculates the player's tile and allows it to interact with the frontmost item or door on that tile.
TODO use interaction system and door objects to properly load the next room AND position the player at the appropriate door in the new room.
---
TODO add scrolling support to the renderer -- update scrolling once every frame using player position
TODO add viewport support to the renderer, which will greatly simplify HUD and menus

# Refactoring
TODO switch the specification of mobs, instead of specifying a protocol for mobs as a whole, specify components, and then add/skip them when needed (e.g. moving, attacking, damage-aura, ...)
TODO decide what to do with the flipped y axis - do we want to flip the axis in the game logic and invert when rendering...? either way will be confusing because the rooms are of varying height.

# Physics
TODO for collision with platforms (Collision::TopOnly) we need to check whether the player passed through the platform between the last frame and the current, and if so stop on it

# Game object
TODO keep a stack of menus. Iff empty, render current room
