# Small fixes
TODO find out why our tiles are rendered with borders
TODO add music support to menus

# Optional features for later
TODO offset background rendering by the height of the highest row that is completely solid in the collision map (consecutive from the bottom, again calculate at makeRoom time)

# Big features
--- Mob rendering
TODO transform mob position when adding to room (in makeRoom) to allow using tile coordinates instead of pixels in room definition
---
TODO add viewport support to the renderer, which will greatly simplify HUD and menus

# Refactoring
TODO switch the specification of mobs, instead of specifying a protocol for mobs as a whole, specify components, and then add/skip them when needed (e.g. moving, attacking, damage-aura, ...)
TODO decide what to do with the flipped y axis - do we want to flip the axis in the game logic and invert when rendering...? either way will be confusing because the rooms are of varying height.

# Physics

# Game object
TODO implement state container
